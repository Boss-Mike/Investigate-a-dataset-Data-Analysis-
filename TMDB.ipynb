    "\n",
    ">In this project, I analyzed the International Movies dataset containing movies from 1960 to 2015.\n",
    ">In this analysis, I observed the movies with the third highest and third lowest budgets respectively.\n",
    ">We also looked at the average words used in a movie title in the year 2006.\n",
    ">We specifically analyzed the common genre of movies that Dwayne Johnson and Chris Hemsworth appeared in the most.\n",
    "\n",
    ">I calculated the movies with the most and least revenues generated respectively, with the movie \"Avatar\" being the highest grossing movie with a revenue of 2.7 billion dollars. It also had a movie rating of 7.1 which is above the average rating of movies(5).\n",
    "\n",
    ">On the contrary, \"Shattered glass\" and \"Mallrat\" were the movies with the lowesr revenues generated.\n",
    "\n",
    ">I also calculated the average runtime of movies in the year 2006.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Robert De Niro is the most featured cast featuring in 72 movies as early as 1973. second to him is Samuel L. Jackson who featured in 71 movies from 1992 to 2015. However, none of the top 5 most featured casts were casts in the highest grossing movies.\n",
    "\n",
    ">This report also established that certain genres were more favourable to users than the others. Although not the most featured genre in the movie industry, the Documentary, Music and History genres had a higher average rating than the other genres.\n",
    "\n",
    ">From this analysis, we can deduce that there's a strong relationship between genre popularity and the revenue generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The key performance index is also derived in this analysis to help in further machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    ">We also notice that genre popularity influences the rating of a movie."
